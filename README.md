### What is DD&I

The Drupal Diversity and Inclusion Workgroup, also known as 'DD&I', is an independent collective of volunteers who advocate for greater diversity in the community and more inclusive events, help create safe spaces, and build the capacity of allies.

### Issue Queue
If there is an issue open in _any_ of our github repositories, it’s available to be worked on. We love to see people in the issue queues, and welcome people jumping in wherever they feel comfortable. 

We try to label issues so that newcomers can quickly find tasks that match their interests. We borrowed this idea from [Girl Develop It’s issue queue](https://github.com/girldevelopit/gdi-website/issues "girl develop it issue queue").

Here are some labels you can start with:

- [Tasks](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ATask) quick things you can work on!
- [Discussions](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3ADiscussion) things we would like to hear your opinion and thoughts on!
- [Intiatives](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AInitiative) the stuff we're working on that needs volunteers and voices!

### Teams

Teams are currently on pause as we need more volunteers to do the work that we do. Get involved by attending our meetings and participating in our [issue queue.](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues)															   
## Initiatives 
- We're currently working on getting some new initiatives off the ground. [Check out the intiatives label in our issue queue](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AInitiative) to see what's upcoming.
