# Content Team

The Content team works on a variety of things from communications to creating and updating content for the website and projects. Our work is a combination of discussions, writing or editing, and organizing.

## List of Responsibilities:
- Update/manage social media channels
- Update website content
- Coordinate content and newsletter
- Create content for DD&I / and DD&I projects
- Somewhat represent the group publicly
- Manage crisis issues like social media bullying, imposters, etc.â€¨

## Subteams
The team's focus can be broken down into:
- Social Media
- Newsletter
- Website/Projects content

## Project Board:
[The Content team's project board ](https://github.com/orgs/drupaldiversity/projects/3 "The Content team's project board ")

### Understanding the Project board:
- Monthly Focus
*The team leader will place the issues into this column after every team meeting or when necessary. Think of this as a priority queue of issues to work on for this month*
- In Progress
*Once you've chosen an issue, please assign it to yourself and move it to this column.*
- Needs Review
*If a task has been completed, needs overview or discussion, move it to this column and let your team know it's ready.*
- Done
*Completed tasks for the month will be here until the board is refreshed for the next month's focus.*

## Issues:
- DD&I in general can be found on the [Admin Repo queue.](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/administration/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Team%3A+Content%22, "Admin Repo queue").
- Content for the website on the [Website issue queue](https://github.com/drupaldiversity/drupaldiversity.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Team%3A+Content%22, "Website issue queue").
